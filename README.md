# uav-onboard

Onboard software for the indoor UAV search mission.

This project owns camera processing, mission state management, MAVLink control,
GCS communication, safety handling, and headless logging.

## Layout

- `config/`: runtime TOML configuration
- `src/`: mission application source
- `tools/`: local development and debugging utilities
- `test_data/`: captured images, videos, and logs for repeatable tests
- `tests/`: unit tests
- `scripts/`: build, deploy, and run helpers
- `docs/`: design notes and protocol reference
- `logs/`: runtime logs

## Build

On a clean Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit install, set up build dependencies first:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_rpi_dependencies.sh
```

Optional development tools:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_rpi_dependencies.sh --with-dev-tools
```

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

## Run

```bash
./uav_onboard --config ../config
```
